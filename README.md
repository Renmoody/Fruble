Project Goal - This project is geared towards public safety. Unfortunately, people end up in positions where they need help but cannot use their mobile device due to dangerous conditions. Our application will use audio detection software to allow the user to use a safe sentance. Doing so will alert local authorities and send and SMS message to contacts of their choosing along with their location with live updates.

Languages - Android studio, Twilio, Python
